note:
Gradle provides methods for working with project properties. These methods can be used to check if a property exists and to get the value of a property.
The project.hasProperty method is used to check if a property exists. It takes the name of the property as a parameter and returns a boolean value. If the property exists, it returns true; otherwise, it returns false.
The project.property method is used to get the value of a property. It takes the name of the property as a parameter and returns the value of the property. If the property does not exist, it returns null.
These methods are useful when you want to conditionally access a property's value in a build script. In the provided code, the 'nama' property is used to determine the name that will be printed in the greeting.
